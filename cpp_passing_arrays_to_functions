/*The code for this file is an exercise to be done in C++
A local supermarket is running a promotion: each Nth customer will receive one item for free. Customers names are sequentially given as array of strings (see template).
Write a function that receives the array of customers, its size, and the N number as arguments, and prints the names of the lucky customers each in a new line.

Sample Input
3

Sample output
Rayan
Bruce
Richard
Mary
Rem
